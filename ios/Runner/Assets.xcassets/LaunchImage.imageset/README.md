# Launch Screen lib/assets

You can customize the launch screen with your own desired lib/assets by replacing the image files in this directory.

You can also do it by opening your Flutter project's Xcode project with `open ios/Runner.xcworkspace`, selecting `Runner/lib/assets.xclib/assets` in the Project Navigator and dropping in the desired images.
